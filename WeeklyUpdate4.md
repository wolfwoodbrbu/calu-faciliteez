This week we are still becoming familiar with the Pi and the operating system Raspbian. Another portion of the week was to research how to translate the data we get from the phiget, or the correlation from the data to temperature and humidity.

We checked and updated raspbian using apt-get update followed by apt-get dist-upgrade at the command line. We downloaded a HTML 5 browser--Epiphany, we are even able to view videos on the Pi now.


# Week 5 Plans #

We have already talked to the other PTC group to get together this week, Wednesday and/or Friday during class time to work on and complete the Login page.
