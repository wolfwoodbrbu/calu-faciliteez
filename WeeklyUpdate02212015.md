> Jared Sheppard picked up the hardware from Aaron Tuomi at PTC. The hardware collected was the Raspberry PI developer kit, the sensor module, and the phidgets board to connect them all together. The Temperature and Humidity team met up during week 2 to set the raspberry PI up, which included:

  * Assembling the Raspberry PI
  * Installing software
  * Connecting the Sensor Module to the Phidgets board
  * Connected the phidgets board to the raspberry PI

# Plans for Week 3 #

> During Week 3, we will further familiarize ourselves with the Raspberry PI and its components in preparation for beginning the main work for the project. Aaron Tuomi suggested that we do as such, and he will contact us shortly afterward. This is expected within the next two weeks.
