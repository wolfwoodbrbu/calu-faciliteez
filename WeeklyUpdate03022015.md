# Implementation Week 6 #




## Overall Work Done ##
This week we worked on getting our Raspberry Pi visible in the ThingWorx Composer. We had problems with being able to see our unbound data and Faye suspected that there were permission problems on the ThingWorx server. She corresponded with Aaron Toumi from PTC and through him we were able to resolve that problem at least(Figure 1).


While we are now able to see the simulated sensor data from the Pi it seems that there are still some lingering permission problems with the ThingWorx server. What we mean by that is that while when viewing the properties of the Sensor Thing we can see the posted sensor data but when we try to view the data in a Mashup the data doesn't seem to be able to be viewed.(See Figure 2 & 3)
