# Implementation Week 5 #




## Overall Work Done ##

This week we meet with the PTC Security team to set up a login page for both projects. Through the ThingWorx Composer we made a rough login screen that doesn't do anything at the moment.

We did try and connect out Raspberry Pi with ThingWorx but ran into the problem that we did not know what the server's address was so we sent an email to Aaron to see if we could get that address. We are expecting a reply on Monday since we emailed him fairly late on Friday.

## Agenda for Week 6 ##

Our goal for week 6 is to start programming the back-end and connecting it to ThingWorx.
