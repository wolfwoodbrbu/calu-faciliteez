# Implementation Week 3 #






## Overall Work Done ##

> We got an adapter for the Raspberry Pi to convert HDMI to DVI output for the video. This allowed us to be able to set up the system in room 309 of Eberly otherwise we had to find a room with a hdmi connection for a projector, not an optimal situation. Once setup in 309 we were able to compile the drivers for the Phidget sensors and run some test software provided by the Phidget website. This program shows the pure analog signals coming from the sensors, when we start to program the back end for the project we will be converting this signal to degrees fahrenheit and the relative humidity percentage in the software.

# Plans for Week 4 #

> During Week 4 we are going to schedule a meeting with the PTC Security team to discuss the design of the front end interface. Faye is going to get see if Telnet is an option for connecting to the Raspberry Pi while it is connected to the CalU network. Either way we will set up Eclipse IDE and download the Java Edge libraries so we can start programming the backend of the project.
